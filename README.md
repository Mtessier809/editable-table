# Editable Table
I created a fully editable table that performs CRUD operations on a MySQL database. 
The frontend was made with React.js, and the backend was made with Express. 
The table also performs client-side filtering, sorting, and pagination by using the react-table library. 

## Technologies used
# Frontend 
* React.js
* react-table
* react-hook-form
* mui material
# Backend

## What I Learned 
* How to create basic api routes, connect to a database, and perform CRUD operations. 
* How to use the React.js framework as well as several front-end libraries such as react-table, react-hook-form, and mui material
* Understanding how the frontend and backend are connected together and how they communicate with each-other.
